        <p>Testing party members executing IQ OQ protocols have the authority to correct minor errors, such as typographical errors, that do not affect the operation of the unit or alter the verifications or change the acceptance criteria. These corrections will be initialed and dated by the person making the amendment.</p>
        <p>Should changes be required after the execution and final approval of the protocol, the revision will be detailed in a separate addendum complete with approval requirements. The same approval list required on the original protocol will be required on any addenda.</p>
