        <p>The goal of the installation qualification and operational qualification protocols is to ensure the unit <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">(SMI12 </span><MadCap:variable name="SL_Units.SL_Product" />) is correctly installed and operates at factory specification in a new workspace environment. This may require adjustments to the unit and the ambient environment in order to provide a constant-temperature <MadCap:variable name="SL_Units.Chamber_Type" /> environment. By the end of the IQ OQ, any discovered deviances or nonconformities should be corrected or remedied.</p>
